------------OUTPUT---------------
A C++ Program to check whether Graph is Connected.?
1. Creating Adjacency Matrix.........
Is there a Flight from Nasik to Nasik ? : 0
Is there a Flight from Nasik to Pune ? : 220
Is there a Flight from Nasik to Mumbai ? : 180
Is there a Flight from Nasik to Nagpur ? : 0
Is there a Flight from Pune to Nasik ? : 220
Is there a Flight from Pune to Pune ? : 0
Is there a Flight from Pune to Mumbai ? : 120
Is there a Flight from Pune to Nagpur ? : 716
Is there a Flight from Mumbai to Nasik ? : 180
Is there a Flight from Mumbai to Pune ? : 120
Is there a Flight from Mumbai to Mumbai ? : 0
Is there a Flight from Mumbai to Nagpur ? : 816
Is there a Flight from Nagpur to Nasik ? : 0
Is there a Flight from Nagpur to Pune ? : 716
Is there a Flight from Nagpur to Mumbai ? : 816
Is there a Flight from Nagpur to Nagpur ? : 0
2. Display Adjacency Matrix.........
 0 220 180 0
 220 0 120 716
 180 120 0 816
 0 716 816 0
Non-Zero Values: Distances in Kilometers
3. Create Adjacency List.........
How many Vertices in Graph: 4
How many adjacent vertices for Nasik : 2
 Enter An Adjacent Vertex: Pune
 Enter An Adjacent Vertex: Mumbai
How many adjacent vertices for Pune : 3
 Enter An Adjacent Vertex: Nasik
 Enter An Adjacent Vertex: Mumbai
 Enter An Adjacent Vertex: Nagpur
How many adjacent vertices for Mumbai : 3
 Enter An Adjacent Vertex: Nasik
 Enter An Adjacent Vertex: Pune
 Enter An Adjacent Vertex: Nagpur
How many adjacent vertices for Nagpur : 2
 Enter An Adjacent Vertex: Pune
 Enter An Adjacent Vertex: Mumbai
Adjacency List is created Successfully...!!!
4. Display Adjacency List.........
 -Head-
 | Nasik |--> Pune --> Mumbai --> NULL
 | Pune |--> Nasik --> Mumbai --> Nagpur --> NULL
 | Mumbai |--> Nasik --> Pune --> Nagpur --> NULL
 | Nagpur |--> Pune --> Mumbai --> NULL
 NULL
5. Check Connected Graph......???
*** The Given Graph is Connected Graph...!!!
